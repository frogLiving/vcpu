### Update 1/8/2019

Like any programmer.  The more one writes code the better one tends to get.  The more you expose yourself to others
code the more you learn.  I have been on a journey to learn even more.  Through this process I have re-written many
functions in this program removed object based code and used regular C code.  As this project continues to progress
I will continue to update my style and also make things easier to use and hopefully understand.

* Updated Readme (several times)
* Completed work on AND16, OR16, NOT16, OR8-way
* Fixed several logical errors (To many to list)
* Updated litature to reflect more accurate vocabulary

### Update 1/7/2019

After a couple of months off, working and read.  I am back at it again.  This time I am adding more intermediate gates.
These new gates will increase the functionality of the virtual cpu.  Some of these new chips include:
* 32-bit input or gate with 16-bit results (16-bit orGate)
* 32-bit input and gate with 16-bit results (16-bit andGate)
* 32-bit input not gate with 16-bit results (16-bit notGate)
* 2-1 multiplexer
* 1-2 deMultiplexer

### Udpate 8/1/18

Today I imported the project from bitbucket to gitlab.  This project was started on OSX and now will cotninue to linux.  Updates coming soon.

### Update 11/19

Pushed 3 new gates to the repo.  I have yet to turn them into a library yet.  I added the following gates: half addr, full addr, 8-bit addr.
Fixed the gitingore.  That was broken and adding a make file that allows you to compile the different pieces
Removed all object files and the pre-compiles library.
